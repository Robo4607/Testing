Testing and learning central

Hey folks. This be the beginning of out Git Greatness.

We will be going with the practice that Chris mentioned, each of us gets a branch and you can make all the changes (commits) you 
want, however, you are to do that in your branch only and then if you think your code is ready then do a pull request on your branch to the master branch.

Branches:

Dylan: Penchant's Home To Roam
Owen: Definitely Not CIA
Parson bro's (Yeah you are still one person to me atm): Parson1 And Parson2
Joel: Master Of The Edge
Logan: Anonymous Solderer

Set up:
1. Make an account and add yourself as a collaborator via Robo4607 account or letting me know your username.
2. Install Git
3. Clone repository: Open Git CMD. Go to desired dump location. (I have currently just used Desktop). Run "git clone https://github.com/Robo4607/Testing.git"
4. Import repository into Eclipse. Open Eclipse, Import, Git, local repository, etc.
5. Now you have access to the same project as everyone. Likely some problems will occur since I don't think I made the paths relative.
6. Have fun fixing and tinkering, you are now using Git. 

Done working? Ready to sync your local branch:
