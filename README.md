# Testing
Testing and learning central

Hey folks. This be the beginning of our Git Greatness.

We will be going with the practice that Chris mentioned, each of us gets a branch and you can make all the changes (commits) you 
want, however, you are to do that in your branch only and then if you think your code is ready then do a pull request on your branch to the master branch.

Branches:

Dylan: Penchant's Home To Roam <br>
Owen: Definitely Not CIA <br>
Parson bro's (Yeah you are still one person to me atm): Parson1 And Parson2 <br>
Joel: Master Of The Edge <br>
Logan: Anonymous Solderer

Set up:
1. Make an account and add yourself as a collaborator via Robo4607 account or letting me know your username. <br>
2. Install Git <br>
3. Clone repository: Open Git CMD. Go to desired dump location. (I have currently just used Desktop). Run "git clone https://github.com/Robo4607/Testing.git" <br>
4. Import repository into Eclipse. Open Eclipse, Import, Git, local repository, etc. <br>
5. Now you have access to the same project as everyone. Likely some problems will occur since I don't think I made the paths relative. <br>
6. Have fun fixing and tinkering, you are now using Git. <br>

Done working? Ready to sync your remote branch with your local branch: <br>
In Eclipse: <br>
Right click on the project. Go to team->remote->Push... <br>
Custom URI, URI: https://github.com/Robo4607/Testing.git. Authenticate with Git username and password. <br>
Source ref: master. Destination ref: %YourBranch%. Do not use master or someone else's branch. Click Add Spec and Finish. 

There is more to Github that we will want to learn but these are the basics to get us started.

If you have any questions just edit this file and add them below.
